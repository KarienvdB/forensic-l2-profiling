Good afternoon, Dr van den Berg

I hope you are well!

It has now been 2 weeks of checking my student portal and still no change.

Is there perhaps someone you could refer me to? 

Kind regards,
Christinet

Good morning, Dr van den Berg
 
I hope you are well! 
 
I would just like to follow up on this? I need my final academic record in order to apply for an MA by Friday. I have just checked my Student360 and the marks have not changed. 
 
Thank you.
Good morning, Dr van den Berg
 
I hope you are well! 
 
I have a quick question regarding the marks showing on my Student360. I believe there might be an error as my mark for Assignment 2 shows 0? Attached is a screenshot.
 
Apologies if you have not completed the uploading process yet. It might also just be a system error on Student360 itself.
Good day, Dr van den Berg

I hope you are well!

I am unsure where to submit my research project. I assume I should send it to you?

Please find my final version attached.

Kind regards,
Christinet

I hope you are well!
 
Just a quick question regarding the Richards & Rogers content for our exam. I remember from the revision class that you mentioned you would not ask us anything that we did not discuss in class. Would I be correct in assuming that this stretches to theories we did not present on? 
 
Would I be set if I had in-depth knowledge of, say, two current methods and two alternative methods, or should I opt to have in-depth knowledge of all of the ones presented in class? From what you mentioned in the revision class, I am expecting a sort of comparative/evaluative question based on the major trends vs current vs alternative methods. 
 
Thanks!
 
Kind regards
Christinet

Please find my assignment attached. Here is the link to the second article I used (also from Medium): https://medium.com/designstudies1/why-papyrus-should-be-left-in-the-past-df59be26d058

Thanks!
Good morning, Dr van den Berg

I really don’t mean for this to be a follow up email. But I did send it a bit late in the afternoon, so I don’t want it to get lost in your inbox

Thanks!
Good afternoon, Dr van der Berg

I identified the following text. Would this one be alright?

Good morning, Dr

I hope you had a lovely weekend!

I wanted to start with my FL assignment, but it seems we need a membership to Medium to access the solar eclipse text. I did log in to my account, but the site is telling me to upgrade my membership.

I was wondering if you could maybe assist? 

Apologies, please also find attached the 'clean' PP without my cameos. 

Good morning, Dr

Thank you so much. I think I will rather give the presentation a skip this morning. I’ll record it and have it with you by the end of the day.

Thanks so much!

Kind regards

Good afternoon, Dr van den Berg

I hope you are well!

I just want to ask something concerning tomorrow's class. 

I have quite a severe and painful infection and spent most of my time in bed this weekend, as it was extremely difficult to move. I am doing much better now, but I am still in pain (especially when I need to sit down for long periods of time).

I am prepared and ready to present in tomorrow's class. However, I wanted to ask if I could please present first, and be excused early?

This email is just precautionary. I am feeling much better and believe I can attend the entire class, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. Could I let you know before class if I will be able to stay after my presentation, if that's alright?

Thank you so much.

Good morning, Dr van den Berg

Thank you so much for the option to do the presentation via video. I apologise for only sending it to you now, the videos on the slides make it quite a big file. I struggled last night but finally managed to get it onto a drive. 

It might be difficult to open or too big to download, so I am working on uploading it via eFundi too.

Thanks, again!

Kind regards
Christinet 

Good day, Dr van den Berg

I hope you are well!
I was thinking about different texts I could consider for my FL essay, and I thought public apologies by organisations might be something interesting to look into? I have read a few and think, like with the hoax emails, there are a few identifiable patterns and set ways brands go about issuing apologies.

Below is a link to an article including possible examples I want to make use of. Would it be possible for you to please have a look at them and let me know if you think this topic would be suited?
