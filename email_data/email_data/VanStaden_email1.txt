Dear Dr Van Den Berg

Attached is the updated proposal and change log. Please let me know if there is anything I missed. Thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it.

Kind regards

Dear Dr Van Den Berg

I have identified a potentially useful assessment and implication strategy in the form of a table detailing both knowledge and performance criteria for supporting and measuring  communicative competence for LSP.

It is table 5 on page 16

Kind regards

Dear Professor, Ravyse

Thank you very much for the assistance and CHE report it will undoubtably prove to be very informative and useful.   

Kind regards

Dear Professor, Ravyse
 
I hope this message finds you well and I apologize for bothering.
I am currently in the process of refining my Master’s research proposal in English Applied Linguistics. My study investigates how AI-driven tools such as ChatGPT, may be used to improve first-year law students’ Legal English vocabulary through contextualised learning practices.
My supervisor, Dr Van Den Berg suggested that I request your assistance in gathering information regarding how legal vocabulary is addresses at undergraduate (specifically first year) level. 
I have been advised by UPSET reviewers to examine how South African universities have responded to the 2018 CHE report, which observed the development of various institutional interventions in the language and law space. I am struggling to find information on this report and I would be most grateful if you could provide any insight into the NWU’s approach to Legal English instruction and vocabulary development within the LLB programme.
More specifically, I would appreciate any information on:
1. The linguistic support structures in place for first-year law students.
2. Whether I could request access to first year LLB study guides
Thank you in advance for your time and consideration and I apologies for any inconvenience related to my request.
 
Kind regards 
Justin van Staden

Dear Dr Van Den Berg

Good Morning Dr. I hope you are well. Dr attached is the latest version of my lit review. I aim to be finished with Chapter two by the 21st of this month and expect to be finished with chapter three by the 18th of May. Apologies for the many delays and slow progress, but I am now making steady progress.

Dr would it it be possible to arrange a meeting later this week? I think I have identified a good link between Legal vocabulary, CLIL and ChatGPT in the form of a lack of background knowledge leading to legal vocabulary being perceived as being highly contextualized despite it inherently being context dependent. 

Thank you for your time and patience Dr.

Dear Dr Van Den Berg

I hope this email finds you well. Dr I have made progress with the literature review and I am currently discussing ChatGPT within the context of Groves (2009) four part framework and Walqui's six strategies.

Dr I have not yet implemented the changes we discussed at our previous meeting as I keep finding new information I would like to add. The inclusion of the three-tier vocabulary framework is particularly relevant as I believe it will be particularly useful during the practical part of the review. 

Dr may I request a meeting with you when you have an opening  to discuss these additions as I am unsure of where to implement them and how I should link them to the review?

Thank you so much for your time and I truly do appreciate it. 
Dear Dr Van Den Berg

I hope this email finds you well. Violet-Ann helped me find the bursary site and the progress report document. Could you kindly complete my progress report for the bursary at your earliest convenience? 

Thank you very much.
Dear Dr Van Den Berg,

Attached is the first part of the literature review, I am close to finishing section 2's draft version and will send it by Wednesday at the latest. I apologize for the sloppy structure of the systematic review, it has undergone a few evolutions over the holoday season, but I think I have a solid grasp on it now. Thank you very much for your time Dr.

Kind regards 
Justin
Hi Dr sorry for bothering. Hope the proposal looks ok, thanks for all your help, I really appreciate it.
Good morning Dr, thank you for allowing me to modify the proposal. Dr I have left in the comment with regards to the previous to our previous conversation regarding the link towards university students. Thank you for the help Dr it is greatly appreciated.
Dear Dr Van Den Berg

Good morning Dr, I hope you are feeling better. Dr I have updated the proposal as per our previous discussion and am currently busy completing the ethical documentation. Thank you for all the assistance Dr. I really appreciate it. Dr would it be possible to arrange another appointment to discuss a few aspects of the proposal and ethical documentation?
Dear Dr Van Den Berg.

Good morning Dr, I hope you are well. I have managed to narrow down the scope of the systematic review into four primary research areas, I am currently busy completing the first of these "objectives" and will send an updated draft version as soon as it is done. 

Dr would it be possible to request an appointment with you during the week? I would like to discuss a few concerns relating to the ethical documentation and the literature review. Thank you very much Dr.

Kind regards
