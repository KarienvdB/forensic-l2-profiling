I hope you are well. I have finalised chapter 2 and started with an outline for chapter 3. The outline is really just the skeleton at this point, so I will start adding the "flesh" in the meantime. Could you maybe just check if I'm taking the right approach with this? If you would like to discuss the outline, we can schedule a meeting. Otherwise, we can meet after I've started filling in some information to the outline. 
From this point, I will start adding "approved" progress to a single file to make merging the documents easier. 

Good morning Dr van den Berg, 

Please find attached my revised version of Chapter 2. Let me know when we can schedule a time to discuss the changes, as well as a way forward. 

Could you clarify if we have received feedback yet from the committee on my proposal? Just wondering as I've heard some of the other MA students have already gotten feedback. 

Have a great weekend!
Thank you for sharing this information! It is much appreciated. Would you be so kind to write a motivation for my application? Perhaps we can discuss possible conference opportunities tomorrow to add to the motivation?
The application form is attached. 

Good afternoon Dr van den Berg, 

Please find attached my completed literature review and synthesis (C2 in progress). I do have copies of all the tables on a separate excel sheet (if anything needs to change). Please let me know when you have worked through the document, so we can schedule a meeting to discuss the progress. 

And please remember to fill in my progress report :)

Good morning, 

I hope this email finds you well. Would you be so kind to fill in the attached progress report needed for the master's bursary? I've already filled in my details. 

Kind regards, 
Violet-Ann
Good morning, 

I have written the first draft of the 'theoretical framework' section in my literature review. Please have a look and let me know where I need to fill some gaps or elaborate more (or less) in a certain direction. Perhaps we can schedule a virtual meet for feedback and discussion of the next step in the process? Because classes are done, my schedule is mostly clear (except for next week Wednesday), so you can set a date and time that suits you. 

In my proposal, I used Lugea & Walker (2023) (as you suggested) as a departing point on using stylistics. However, I cannot access the Lugea & Walker (2023) article... 
As this forms part of Methodology, do I need to discuss this in the lit review already, or save it for Methodology?

In the meantime, I will continue reading and start drafting the unpacking of the studies. 

Kind regards, 
Violet-Ann
Morning,

These are all relevant to the method, do I need to include it in the lit review already, or should it be mentioned in the methodology section?

At this stage, I don't think it is necessary. Though it could be helpful to have an extra eye specialising in micro linguistics, which I know is Dr Botha's field? What are your thoughts?

Kind regards, 
Noted, thank you. Adding it to my "to-do list" for the lit review. 

Kind regards, 
Please rather consider this draft. I found a few tiny mistakes under the Literature review section which I fixed. I had a last check and a final check on the proposal and I think we are good to go. The only blank space left that I can see is that we do not have co-supervisor filled in. Is a this a necessary field to fill? 

Please find the final draft attached. 

Good morning, 

I had a look at the content and only tweaked where I thought necessary (I enabled track changes so you can see). I am happy with the title. I wonder if we need to bring in the part that it is a comparative study, but I don't think it is absolutely necessary. What are your thoughts on this?
I am enrolled for a MA in Applied Language studies, but I did correct this. 

The reference list has not been updated yet, is this a technicality/ template, to show the different type of sources? This just needs to be updated with my reference list. I did not change it, as I'm not 100% certain if it should be in another format. 

Thank you for making the time and effort to tweaking my proposal to perfection!

Kind regards, 
Violet-Ann

Good morning Dr van den Berg, 

I am applying for NRF funding and would like to ask that you please fill out a supervisor recommendation letter to be submitted to the institution. I've already completed the student section, you just need to fill out section B (it's rather short). 
The applications close on the 28th of June. I am still completing my online application, but want to sort this section out so long. 

Attached is the form to be filled out. 
Please find attached my revised MA proposal. I am going to be in Potch until Saturday morning, should you like to schedule a meeting. I realize that it is very short notice, so we can also meet online next week if it suits you better :) 
Thank you for effort with the feedback, I will work through it during this week. 
I can meet Friday at 9. 
Good morning Dr van den Berg,

I trust you are well. Have you had a chance to look at my research proposal yet? 
Are you happy with format and are there any changes I need to make before we submit?
